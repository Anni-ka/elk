# Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK)

Diagrams and visual languages are a great thing,
but getting the layout just right for them to be easily understandable
can be tedious and time-consuming.
The Eclipse Layout Kernel provides a number of layout algorithms
as well as an Eclipse-based infrastructure to connect them
to editors and viewers.
The layout algorithms are plain Java
and can thus also be used outside of Eclipse.

If you want to know more,
let us refer you [to the ELK homepage.](http://www.eclipse.org/elk).
